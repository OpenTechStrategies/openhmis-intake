This is a list of manual tests that we need to run to make sure this app
is working correctly.  It isn't complete yet -- feel free to add more,
and definitely add more when you add new functionality.

  - search after editing (should show new/changed info)
- export

- import
  - should show success/error messages for each line of the csv
  - should error for non-csvs, not-correctly-formatted csvs, etc.
